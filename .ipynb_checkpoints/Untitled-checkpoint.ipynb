    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things that make us wonder about tennis and wealthy parents. Firstly, two of the top 100 women tennis players have billionaire parents. Second, a tweet one of us saw wondering why so many formula one drivers fathers have hyperlinks in wikipedia (hinting that you need a rich father to become a formula 1 driver). Formula one is not tennis (race car driving is much more expensive than playing tennis for example), but this tweet gave us the idea that maybe you could tell if a person was wealthy by their wiki page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does having a wealthy parent make you a better tennis player? We take a look at the current world top tennis players, and examine if being from a wealthy family makes it more likely for them to win, when playing professional tennis. We also examine if having wealthy parents is \"priced into the betting odds when betting on tennis matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Datasets used:\n",
    "- ATP (Men's professional tennis association) and WTA (Women's professional tennis association) tennis player lists\n",
    "- Tennis results from the years 2019 - 2022\n",
    "- Tennis betting odds from the years 2019 - 2022\n",
    "- List of tennis players that have wiki pages, and a boolean if there parents have wiki pages\n",
    "- Chat gpt answers to the question \"did this tennis player have wealthy parents?\"\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Is having wealthy parents a predictor of becoming a professional tennis player?\n",
    "2. Is having wealthy parents a predictor of future success as a professional tennis player?\n",
    "3. Is there money to be made by taking into account if a tennis player has wealth parents, when betting on a tennis matches?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more top tennis players that have wealthy parents than the average population. Also tennis players with wealthy parents are more likely to win, even when playing other top tennis players. The information that having wealthy parents makes you a better tennis player is not priced into the betting odds.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used Chat-GPT and Wikipdia to try to determine if players had wealthy parents. These methods did not agree with each other, so the conclusions above should be taken with this in mind.\n",
