    "Does having wealth parent make you a better tennis player? There are lots of ways to analise this. We can look at if the current world top tennis players are mostly from wealth families. We can look if being from a wealthy family makes it more likely you will win when playing profesional tennis. Assuming this is true we can look if having wealthy parents is \"priced in\" to the betting odds when betting on tennis matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two things that make us wonder about tennis and wealthy parents. Firstly there are two of the top 100 woman tennis players have billionare parent. Second a tweet one of us saw wondering why so many formula one drivers fathers have hyperlinks in wikipedia (hinting that you need a rich father to become a formular 1 driver).\n",

    "\n",
    "Would could see if there is a correlation between rich partents and tennis success when playing as a pro (look at results from pro matches). \n",
    "we could look at win % vs wealthy parents\n",
    "\n",
    "If answer is yes, wealth parents make you play better as a pro, then we can look to see if this is taken into account in the betting odds.\n",
    "For each player, we could work out how much you would have won / lost, if you had bet a constant amount on that player, over there last x number of games. We can then have a way of saying who is a profitable player and who is an unprofitable player to bet on. We can then see if this correlates with if they have rich/famous parents.\n",
